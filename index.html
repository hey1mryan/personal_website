        <div class="hobbiesHeading">Hobbies</div>
        <div class="hobbiesDescriptionVolleyball">I enjoy many sports, such as badminton or basketball. However, my favorite sport is volleyball. I love the thrill of a speeding ball coming at you and having to pass it and set it with accuracy. My main position is libero, but I can also play setter. I started off playing basketball at a very young age, and later started badminton in 2022. Just a year later, in 2023, I fell in love with volleyball and it has become my main sport since then.</div>
        <img class="volleyballImage" src="images/volleyball.jpg">
        <div class="hobbiesDescriptionGuitar">I love music, and I love playing instruments too. I primarily play guitar, but I also have light to mediocre experience with bass, drums, and piano. I can play both acoustic and electric guitar, but I prefer electric. I started playing acoustic guitar in early 2022, and later learned electric guitar in 2023. I also learned the basics of the other previously mentioned instruments in early 2023. </div>
        <img class="guitarImage" src="images/electric_guitar.jpg">
        <div class="hobbiesDescriptionGames">I've enjoy playing video games in my free time, ever since a young age. I used to play super random games on my parents' phones, such as Hill Climb Racing or Pixel Gun 3D. Now, some games I play are Minecraft and Valorant. When playing Minecraft, I enjoy calm sessions of building and exploring in an open world. However, on Valorant, I like the intensity of each match, forcing me to concentrate and be strategic. I usually play Reyna, in case you were wondering.</div>
        <img class="gamesImage" src="images/minecraft_photo.jpg">
        <div class="hobbiesDescriptionAnime">In addition to all of the above, I also love watching new shows and anime series. My favorite anime is Demon Slayer, where the main protagonist seeks revenge for what a mysterious demon did to his family. I'm extremely excited for the Infinity Castle movie trilogy that is set to release in the coming years. Another anime I really enjoyed was Death Note, which was filled with strategic planning and a huge police investigation. I love almost anything mystery, stragety, or crime related, and I'm willing to take suggestions.</div>
